# GPT-6.1 high adaptation — okazaky-084783

Target model: `gpt-6.1-sol`; reasoning effort: `high`.
Track: adapted replication. Status: draft; not visually validated.
Creator: @okazaky. Source: https://x.com/okazaky/status/2107826563786084783
Reference page: None
Original prompt SHA-256: `607a187e5b2ac8a711a0d5d67b96a7cd8e09f23d444a3d8c0d70c5969b0f07bd`.

## Source completeness

Upstream marks this as a full prompt. This does not establish that all referenced assets or prior chat context are available.
Dependency cues found by automated text inspection: audio_dependency.

## GPT task

Recreate the intent and complete scope of the creator material quoted below. Preserve subjects, brands, language, exact text, quantities, runtime, aspect ratio, scene order and requested interactions. A model name mentioned as the authoring tool does not change the requested on-screen content. Do not replace Claude/Opus branding when it is part of the actual scene.

Before an exact reproduction, inspect the original film across every scene and transition, and write a timed reconstruction brief with composition, camera, materials, motion, text and sound. Label every inferred choice. When an essential attachment, product, song, private directory or prior conversation is missing, record the missing input and stop that reproduction; do not invent it and claim a match.

Preserve geometry, materials, lighting, camera path, subject scale, scene density and physical interactions. Inspect near and far surfaces and important occlusions.

Upstream remake implementation tags (descriptive, not proof of the original stack): unspecified.

Use the creator's explicit renderer when specified. Otherwise use the host's video workflow (HyperFrames where available). Keep rendering infrastructure identical between benchmark tracks wherever possible. Use local, credited dependencies and record external asset/tool contributions. Make the result seekable for matched-time inspection; never substitute reference scene code, exported frames or the original movie for newly generated scene assembly.

Deliver editable source, the exact model input, model/effort/CLI metadata, dependency and asset ledger, rendered MP4 and poster, and a review record. Check subject coverage, timing, geometry/materials, typography, camera, motion and audio at matching decoded timestamps. Report technical validity and visual fidelity separately. Do not assign a pass or score before actual reference review.

## Creator material — verbatim

<creator_material>
Create a 50-second vertical music video using programmatic rendering (Three.js) instead of native video AI.
1. Generate song with Suno. Extract lyrics from embedded metadata.
2. Separate stems with Demucs (vocals, drums, bass, other).
3. Transcribe vocals with mlx_whisper. Align with official lyrics to create script where '1 lyric line = 1 scene'.
4. Write storyboard: define 'What to show in 3D', 'Camera', 'Main word' for each lyric line.
5. Have 4 parallel Opus sub-agents write scene programs.
6. Export 16-frame contact sheet for visual verification.
7. Render headless Chrome at 1080x1920, 60fps.
8. Normalize volume to -14 LUFS.
Style: Engraving-like lines, colors limited to Black, Bone, Orange.
