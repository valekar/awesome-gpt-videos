# GPT-6.1 high adaptation — techhalla-498547

Target model: `gpt-6.1-sol`; reasoning effort: `high`.
Track: adapted replication. Status: draft; not visually validated.
Creator: @techhalla. Source: https://x.com/techhalla/status/2103411244468498547
Reference page: https://skillry.dev/ai-videos/opus-5-5/techhalla-498547
Original prompt SHA-256: `6c35975fb00e7bfc18cc98a8a05e238fc0037764666d84b465f8bb204e658772`.

## Source completeness

Upstream marks this as a full prompt. This does not establish that all referenced assets or prior chat context are available.
Dependency cues found by automated text inspection: none detected; manual reference review still required.

## GPT task

Recreate the intent and complete scope of the creator material quoted below. Preserve subjects, brands, language, exact text, quantities, runtime, aspect ratio, scene order and requested interactions. A model name mentioned as the authoring tool does not change the requested on-screen content. Do not replace Claude/Opus branding when it is part of the actual scene.

Before an exact reproduction, inspect the original film across every scene and transition, and write a timed reconstruction brief with composition, camera, materials, motion, text and sound. Label every inferred choice. When an essential attachment, product, song, private directory or prior conversation is missing, record the missing input and stop that reproduction; do not invent it and claim a match.

Preserve visual hierarchy, exact UI states, typography, beat grid, morph continuity and loop seam. Inspect all transition states as well as settled frames.

Upstream remake implementation tags (descriptive, not proof of the original stack): canvas. Recompute Canvas state from time; reset transforms and compositing on every frame.

Use the creator's explicit renderer when specified. Otherwise use the host's video workflow (HyperFrames where available). Keep rendering infrastructure identical between benchmark tracks wherever possible. Use local, credited dependencies and record external asset/tool contributions. Make the result seekable for matched-time inspection; never substitute reference scene code, exported frames or the original movie for newly generated scene assembly.

Deliver editable source, the exact model input, model/effort/CLI metadata, dependency and asset ledger, rendered MP4 and poster, and a review record. Check subject coverage, timing, geometry/materials, typography, camera, motion and audio at matching decoded timestamps. Report technical validity and visual fidelity separately. Do not assign a pass or score before actual reference review.

## Creator material — verbatim

<creator_material>
You are a world-class motion designer doing a 20.00s kinetic identity bumper for TechHalla — an AI creator known for stealable workflows, not vibes. This piece must feel like the best designer in the room made a street-poster that moves. Showreel stakes: if this is weak, you don’t get hired.

DURATION: exactly 20.00 seconds. LOOPABLE: frame 0 == frame last (position, opacity, cursor if any).
FORMAT: one HTML file, 1080×1080 (square, X-native). 60fps.
PALETTE (strict):
- bg # 0A0A0A
- magenta # FF2BD6
- acid green # B8FF00
- white # F5F5F5 only for primary readable type when needed
No other hues. No gradients on UI chrome. Magenta/green may misregister (print offset) by 2–4px on impact frames only.

TYPE SYSTEM (use all three; never one font for everything):
1) Display / scream: Archivo Black (or equivalent ultra-condensed black) — 1–4 words max
2) Urban grotesque: Syne ExtraBold — secondary hits, stacked lines
3) Mono / “prompt code”: IBM Plex Mono Medium — small labels, timestamps, fake prompt crumbs
Tracking: display −40 to −80; mono +20. Optical kerning. No cute script fonts.

MESSAGE (locked — do not soften, do not add filler slogans):
Beat hits in this exact order:
1. STOP SCROLLING
2. AI VIDEO ISN’T EXPENSIVE
3. BAD PROMPTING IS
4. WORKFLOWS > WISHES
5. STEAL THE PROMPT
6. @ TECHHALLA
Supporting crumbs (mono, ≤18 chars, never full sentences): JSON · H3 · SEEDANCE · 0 KEYFRAMES · MAGNIFIC · COPY/PASTE

NARRATIVE ARC (20s):
0.0–2.5s  COLD OPEN — “STOP SCROLLING” slams in from below with spring overshoot; magenta smear trail; acid green baseline ticks across like a waveform.
2.5–6.5s  THESIS A — “AI VIDEO ISN’T EXPENSIVE” locks to a poster grid (baseline grid 8px). Letters scramble (seeded Fisher–Yates per glyph) then snap on the beat.
6.5–10.5s THESIS B — “BAD PROMPTING IS” replaces it via mask wipe through the letterforms (the outgoing line is the mask). Magenta/green channel split on the cut.
10.5–14.5s PROOF FLASH — rapid kinetic stack: WORKFLOWS > WISHES, then mono crumbs orbit a central block like a terminal. One fake “prompt block” types 3 lines max, then gets crossed by an acid green strikethrough that becomes a underline for STEAL THE PROMPT.
14.5–17.5s BRAND LOCK — @ TECHHALLA centers; display weight. A thick magenta bar and a thin acid green rule form an L-bracket mark (custom, not a logo download).
17.5–20.0s SETTLE / LOOP — hold lockup; micro-breath (scale 1.000→1.012→1.000); last frame == first ready for loop.

CONCRETE TECHNIQUES (required — implement, don’t approximate):
1. seek(t) pure function of time. No CSS transitions. No setInterval. No React state across frames.
2. Springs = closed-form step responses. Stack one spring per target change so motion stays deterministic.
3. Kinetic type: per-glyph spring (y, opacity, blur). Stagger = 1/16 note at 120 BPM (125ms).
4. Print misregistration: on accent frames only, duplicate text layer offset (±2–4px) in magenta and acid green at 40% opacity.
5. Mask reveal: destination text revealed by animating a path mask derived from the outgoing word’s outlines.
6. Camera: one orthographic camera; only punch-in (1.0→1.08) and horizontal smash-pans timed to beats — never random drift.
7. Motion blur: render 4 subframes per frame, blend (tmix-style).
8. Beat grid: 120 BPM, downbeat at t=0. Something must land on every beat for the first 16 beats; after that, every other beat is ok.
9. Pre-pass: before full render, export one still per major beat (8 frames). Fix cramped type, orphan words, low contrast — then render.

BANNED:
Generic AI clichés (brains, robots, neural nets, sparkles), soft gradients, bouncy cartoon easing, particle explosions, stock “futuristic HUD”, long paragraphs, narrator essay energy, Canva-deck energy, extra slogans beyond the locked message, purple/blue neon, glassmorphism.

If Astra already blew our minds… Opus 5.5 is a monster 😱
